😎 Hi species, I’m @rlcloninger. The temporary, finite observer in your town.
💼 I am interested in the sweet payoff that comes from sewing my participation into a project or task that I've already loved in a prior life | #maximumeffort
🎙️ I find myself learning how to shorten my sentences. This is mainly to prevent anyone new I might meet from walking around as a retarded ape after an introduction.
🍻 Lately I have been collaborating with my business partner, and friend, on a new venture that will make us both very happy and at peace one day.
📧 A sure-fire bet on getting in touch with me is to [send an email my way] (g8z.dxwn11@gmail.com).
